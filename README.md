#Ersilia 

Ersilia Open Source Initiative is a nonprofit organisation that is focused on the research into infectious diseases. We intend to fast-track the development of new medicines by utilizing artificial intelligence tools.

The Ersilia Model Hub is the key project of the Ersilia Open Source Initiative. It is a free repository which contains Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI/ML) models. The aim is to provide user friendly models to scientists to aid their research and predict outcomes easily without requiring complex coding abilities.

Currently, majority of the developed tools, including published and open-sourced, remain unusable to a vast majority of the scientific community who lack the necessary expertise. This is problematic especially in Low and Middle Income Country institutions with limited access to bioinformatic facilities or data science experts. This project aims to provide access to this expertise and support research into a variety of neglected and infectious diseases.

The models embedded in the hub include established models as well as propriety models developed by the Ersilia team.
